# Rock vs Mine Prediction



Machine Learning project to **classify underwater objects** as either **rocks** or **mines** based on their features.



---



## 📝 Project Overview



- **Objective:** Predict whether an object is a rock or a mine.  

- **Dataset:** Contains numerical features from sonar signals of underwater objects.  

- **Approach:** Build and train a classification model to distinguish rocks from mines.

&nbsp; - Handle missing values  

&nbsp; - Standardize and clean features  

&nbsp; - Split data into training and test sets  



- **Model Training**

&nbsp; -I Used machine learning algorithm ->Logistic Regression

&nbsp; - Train the model on sonar dataset  



- **Evaluation**
