## Rock vs Mine Prediction

# 

# This project is a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on its features. It demonstrates a basic implementation of classification using Python and popular ML libraries.

# 

### 📝 Project Overview

# 

# - **Objective:** Build a model that can accurately classify underwater objects as rocks or mines.

# - **Dataset:** The dataset contains numerical features corresponding to different objects, typically derived from sonar signals.

# - **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter/Colab Notebook.

# 

# ## 🚀 Features

# 

# - **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, standardizes features, and prepares data for training.

# - **Model Training:** Implements a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression or other ML models) to learn patterns from the data.

# - **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

# - **Prediction:** Allows users to input custom data for predictions.
