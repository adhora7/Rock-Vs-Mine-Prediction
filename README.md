# 

# This project is a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on its features. It demonstrates a basic implementation of classification using Python and popular ML libraries.

# 

### 📝 Project Overview

# 

# - **Objective:** Build a model that can accurately classify underwater objects as rocks or mines.

# - **Dataset:** The dataset contains numerical features corresponding to different objects, typically derived from sonar signals.

# - **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter/Colab Notebook.
